The guy with the torch isn't me, but sometimes it feels that way. Which is just
to say that I'm still working on this project. I hope to be filling out The Writing
section sometime in the future. But you don't have to wait on me; you can go on and
read the books, etc. on your
own.

<A NAME="why"></A><H4>Why Orwell?</H4>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In his lifetime, <A HREF="orwell.html">George Orwell</A>
was not famous nor even widely read, he held no government position
and exerted no real influence on world affairs. Of his books,
only <A HREF="1984.html">Nineteen Eighty-Four</A> and <A HREF="farm.html">Animal Farm</A>
are at all still read or even remembered. Why then should YOU
be interested in George Orwell? Simply because Orwell, more clearly
than most, saw and wrote the TRUTH.
<P>
Orwell did not invent the TRUTH; no one did. The TRUTH
has been around since the very beginning (and maybe even before
that). And, Orwell's TRUTH is not merely &quot;The Truth According
To Orwell&quot;; it is THE TRUTH. It is that TRUTH which has been at all times and
still is struggled after by all religions, by all men and women.
It is something enduring which is in everyone and
everything that exists. When (and if) we get down to really feeling
it, it's pretty obvious. Thus, the writings of George Orwell,
the best of which is Nineteen Eighty-Four, present a deeply emotional
(and disturbing) picture of both the TRUTH and the consequences
of our turning from it. Orwell presents us with a picture of humanity;
of US. Orwell's genius is that he could see it so clearly and
create such simple but incredibly powerful images and ideas with
which to express this TRUTH.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I first became acquainted with George Orwell when in high
school I read Nineteen Eighty-Four, his last and, I believe, his
greatest work. Unlike most others who have read this book, it
was not assigned reading; I merely found it among the other books
kept on my parents' bookshelf. (Thinking back, I was probably
attracted to this book by its stark and simple title. &quot;What
did it mean?&quot;, I must have wondered.) I don't really recall
the actual reading of Nineteen Eighty-Four (not much conscoiously
moved or impressed me when I was a kid). And I did not read another
of his books or anything else by Orwell until after graduate school.
<P>
Then, in my early thirties, merely looking for &quot;something&quot;
to read, I decided to re-read Nineteen Eighty-Four. As I began
to read, I was stunned to find how Orwell so deeply touched something
within me, and I realized what a profound effect my first reading
of Nineteen Eighty-Four must have had. (The only other book with
which I have had the same experience is The Fountainhead by Ayn
Rand, which I also read at about the same time I read Nineteen
Eighty-Four.) Orwell spoke so directly and clearly to me; he understood
and could so simply but accurately articulate all of the feelings
which I had always had, but of which I had never before been so
distinctly and consciously aware. As I followed Winston Smith's
agonizing struggle to find and maintain his identity within a
group so dedicated to the eradication of all individuality, my
own long standing feelings of isolation (alienation), of &quot;being
different&quot; and outside began to take a more intellectual and philosophic
shape. For the first time, I began to think about myself in terms
of the larger world and its &quot;group dynamics&quot;. I no longer
saw my alienation (and isolation) as being based only on my own
psychological make-up, but realized that this group dynamic (when
linked with my own psychology) was a significant factor.
<P>
Reading Nineteen Eighty-Four was like somehow miraculously
coming home. This was so curious, because the actuality of Winston
Smith's life and place, and of Orwell's, too, were, apparently
so unlike my own. But I soon realized that it was not the outward
circumstances of the story, or even of Orwell the man, which struck
such deep recognition; it was the ideas, the understandings, the
emotional content and connection, the fabulous truth that Orwell
knew and revealed which resonated so deeply within me, within
my own feelings.
<P>
After reading Nineteen Eighty-Four, I felt compelled to
inhale every other bit of Orwell's writing. I began with <A HREF="farm.html">Animal Farm</A>
and, as I could find them, I then read every one of his other
books (mostly in chronological order) and a number of his collected
essays. Then I re-read Nineteen Eighty-Four.<BR>
